# EmbedlyCards

A plugin for Known to enable rich link embedding via Embedly Cards.
Bookmark links will be turned into Embedly Cards by default.  A plugin setting
allows for the default embedder to be preferred with Embedly as the fallback.

Additionally any link in any content type with the class of 'embedly-card' will
be rendered as a rich embedded card.

## Instructions

Upload the plugin the IdnoPlugins directory of the Known installation.  The
directory should be called EmbedlyCards.

Enable the plugin through the site configuration page.
